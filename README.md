## Features

- Add Task: Easily add new tasks to keep track of your activities.

- Edit Task: Modify task details whenever needed to stay organized.

- Delete Task: Remove tasks that are no longer relevant or completed.

- Mark as Completed: Keep track of completed tasks by marking them as done.

## Tech Stack

Technologies Used

- TypeScript: The entire project is written in TypeScript, providing a statically typed and scalable codebase.

- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework used for styling the app, ensuring a clean and responsive design.

## Lessons Learned

- Typescript seems little overwhelming at first, but simplies stuff later.

- For example if you pass in the prop to a new component just bcoz you specified its type it provides you the respective helper functions, this is not the case in JS React.
